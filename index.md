### Quick Ideas
1.
Form - Custom hardware, physical hardware each person places finger on a device sensor
Configuration - Multi person, game with multiple people causing stress
Input - Biometrics - measuring heartrate of each person and anyone outside the measured output sends data
Output - Haptic - Highest measurement gets zapped by device
<br>
2.
Form - Mobile app
Configuration - Multiperson use app on their phone
Input - Environment Sensors collects each persons data (Geolocation) gives their weather
Output - Informationa Tells people if they will also get rain
