### Quick Ideas
1.
Form - Custom hardware, physical hardware each person places finger on a device sensor <br>
Configuration - Multi person, game with multiple people causing stress <br>
Input - Biometrics - measuring heartrate of each person and anyone outside the measured output sends data <br>
Output - Haptic - Highest measurement gets zapped by device <br>

2.
Form - Mobile app <br>
Configuration - Multiperson use app on their phone. <br>
Input - Environment Sensors collects each persons data (Geolocation) gives their weather <br>
Output - Informationa Tells people if they will also get rain

<br>

### My Ideas
Form - Custom Hardware <br>
Configuration - Nonhuman <br>
Input - Manual Controls <br>
Output - Informational <br>
This could be an informative biometrics reader for cats and dogs, to inform the owner of the animals health such as vitals, temperature, and fatigue. It could be made from a microbit with a heart rate monitor and also reading the animals temperature, a wifi chip or blueetooth could be used to send the information to a web application. This device could be made in a small form factor to be used as a collar attatchment, provided these biometrics can be read from the neck area.
